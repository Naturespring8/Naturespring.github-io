         <h3> There are so many things that are happening right now, but let's take a look about Soil pollution. Soil pollution is something that is inevitable anymore but we can actually reduce it in our own ways. It contains toxic compounds that can ruin the land or even the ecosystem, so lets be extra careful. Our focus is about the hazardous waste that were already affecting the soil, so how we will improve the soil and avoid soil pollution? </h3>
