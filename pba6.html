         <h2>Background of the solution and problem</h2>
         <h3>Soil pollution can be one of the most lethal and dangerous
         pollutions that there are some places on earth that has soil
         pollution but the most common are Chernobyl, Kabwe, Dzerzhinsk Russia,
         Haina Dominican Republic, Ukraine, Zambia, and La Oroya Peru. The solution
         for this problem is to inform and make them do the solutions that they can
         easily do, infact some of the solutions were actually included in our daily
         chores like putting your trash in a trashcan or sweeping the floor or outside
         your house.You can easily ask a permission to your guardians or parents to help with your activity which is planting called phytoremediation. Phytoremediation was a practice way before to improve soil quality and many more and there is actually a proof that phytoremediation is a big help and since it is cheap, sustainable, eco-friendly, and effective but ofcourse it is recommended that it should be a high biomass plants to absorb or degrade all the toxins easily and to grow faster. But of course in the future, we also want other authorities to be responsible for the remediation and treatment cost for polluted areas.</h3>
